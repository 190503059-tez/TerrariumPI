Here you can find how you can setup various parts that works together as a single enclosure. You can even setup multiple enclosures. But make sure that relays and areas are not shared in multiple enclosures or areas.

A simple rule to remember: *A relay can only be used once*.
## Login
![New relay form](/assets/img/Login.webp){: style="max-height: 100px" .right}
After the installation, you need to setup TerrariumPI. In order to do that, login with a browser at http://[raspberry_pi]:8090 and click on the `Login` link on the left side menu. The default login should be **admin** / **password** ([FAQ]({% link _faq/login.md %}))

## Help
On every form popup you have a small question mark <i class="far fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> next to the form title. Click on it to get more information about the form fields.

## Required fields
All fields with a red start (<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">*</span>) are required to fill out. Some fields can be come required based on selected options.

## Settings
![Settings form](/assets/img/Settings.webp)

:  Enter the user name for authentication. Default admin

New password
:  Enter a new password for authentication. [Encrypted]({% link _tabs/features.md %}#admin-password)

Confirm new password
: Confirm the new password for authentication.

### Cloud
In the cloud group you can enter credentials for different cloud integrations

#### Meross
With the Meross cloud you can use all the relays and sensors that are connected to your account.

Meross username
: The username to login to your Meross cloud account. [Encrypted]({% link _tabs/features.md %}#other-sensitive-data)

Meross password
: The password to login to your Meross cloud account. [Encrypted]({% link _tabs/features.md %}#other-sensitive-data)

## Weather
![Weather source form](/assets/img/Weather_Settings.webp)
_Popup form adding/updating the weather source_

With the weather data you can schedule your light system based on the **sun rise** and **sun set**. This can either be at your home location, or any other location. The sun rise and set times will be shifted to your home location times. So when it is day at 08:00 at the given location, TerrariumPI will thread that as 08:00 local time. This way, you can have seasons with shorter and longer days, based on day of the year.

Other weather data is just for show. Does not have a function.

### Setup
In order to use the weather system, you need to create a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up).

The url format needs to be `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=[City],[Country]&appid=[API_KEY]`. Do not add the `&metric=` part in the url.

Webcams
: One or more webcams that are used in this enclosure. Webcams selected here can use the `archive light state`  and `archive door state` option at the [webcam settings](#webcams).

## Areas
Adding and changing areas is done here. But as areas have a but more functionality, they are discussed per area type. The most important is that there is an area configured as `main lights` as this will influence the timing of other areas if they depend on the timing of the main lights. Without this, the system will not work.

Also make sure that the light area has relays configured at the `Day settings` tab.

Depending on the combination of `Type` and `Mode` some fields are disabled and not used. The values that are shown will be ignored during the operating of the software.

Three fields are always required and shared in all the area types:

Enclosure
: Select the enclosure to which this area belongs.

Type
: Select the type of area. Depending on the type, new/different opions are available.

Name
: The name of the area. Use an easy to remember name.

### Main Lights
![Area form](/assets/img/Area_Settings.webp)
_Popup form for adding and updating areas_

Mode
: Select the operating mode of this area. Use timer for custom on and off times. Weather is using your [configured weather data](#weather)

Minimum hours
: Enter the minimum hours that the lights should be on. If the day based on the weather data is shorter, the lights will stay on for at least this amount of time.

Maximum hours
: Enter the maximum hours that the lights should be on. Reverse of minimum hours.

Hours shift
: Shift the time that the lights should go on based on the weather sun rise. Can be a positive or negative decimal value (ex: -1.3)

Main lights
: Toggle this if the lights are the main lights on the enclosure. This is used for other areas that depend on this light area. **Make sure at least one light area has the toggle main lights set**

Then you need to setup at least the `Day settings` tab else the software will not work. Do not use the same relay in the day and night settings. That does not work. A relay configured in the day settings part, will be off during the night period.

In the day and night setting tab you can configure the following:

Begin time
: This is the start time when the relay(s) should go on.

End time
: This is the end time when the relay(s) should go off. The duration between begin and end time call we the `operating window`

On duration
: Here you can finetune the time that the relay(s) should on in **minutes** time. Enter a value of **0** to put the relays on for the complete operating window time.

Off duration
: Enter the amount of **minutes** the relay(s) should be off during the operating window. Enter **0** to disable.

**Timer functionality:** When you have an operating window of 10 hours, and selected 45 min on duration and 15 min off duration, you will get a that the relays will toggle on at the start, run for 45 minutes, and go off for 15 minutes. As this is in total 1 hour, this will be repeated 10 times during the operating window time.

Relays
: Here you select the relay(s) that needs to be controlled. When you select a relay, depending on the type, you will get extra tabs where you can either set the on/off dimming duration or relay delay when the relay(s) are toggled on or off.

**Simulate sun rise/set**: When you select a dimmer and a normal relay, you could setup the dimmer to go on in 30 minutes, and delay the normal relay for 30 minutes, so that when the dimmer is at full power, the other light is toggled on. This will give a nice sun rise effect.
