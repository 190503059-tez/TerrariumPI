Here are some features that TerrariumPI has.

## Password encryption
All sensitive data like usernames and password are encrypted in the database. That means when you database is lost, your passwords will not be comprimised. The data is encrypted with a salt that is based on the Raspberry PI CPU. Therefore you cannot copy/move the terrariumpi.db file between different Raspberry PIs.

## Local weather
Using local weather data, you can use sunrise and sunset as timers for your lights or other relays. This way you get automatically seasons following the season outside.

## Multilanguage


## Multiple enclosures
