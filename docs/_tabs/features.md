Here are some features that TerrariumPI has.

## Password encryption
All sensitive data like usernames and password are encrypted in the database. That means when you database is lost, your passwords will not be comprimised. The data is encrypted with a salt that is based on the Raspberry PI CPU. Therefore you cannot copy/move the terrariumpi.db file between different Raspberry PIs.
