## Information
EG-PM2 / EG-PMS2 is a power outlet strip with advanced power management features. It is possible to individually switch 4 sockets on or off manually via your PC, by timer schedule, or by programmable special events (eg: switch on my scanner whenever I start Photoshop, or have my printer switched on only when I really print)
