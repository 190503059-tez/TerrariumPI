If you are running the software for a while, it is handy to backup some files in case of SD card corruption or any other reason that you have to reinstall the software. So here is a list of files that should be saved at a regular basis:

- log/logging.custom.cfg (optional)
- webcam/archive/* (optional) - Here you can find all the archived images of the used webcams
