logcheck Version 0.3

This is a Python-script to parse the logfile from TerrariumPI and send a notification over ntfy.

Dependencies:
Python
ntfy	-	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ntfy
pygtail	-	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygtail
parse	-	https://pypi.python.org/pypi/parse

Function:
The script opens the logfile of TerrariumPI with pygtail. Pygtail allows the script to start 
behind the last read row of the log.
With parse, the different lines will be parsed. Ntfy is used for sending notifications.

The script itself parses the read lines and searches for the log-Levels and the modules.
If the script finds a logfile-line containing a module in combination with a log-level, 
you'll get one or more notifications, depending on your ntfy-config.

Configuration:
To configure ntfy, use the described website.
It's possible to use the default-config-file of ntfy, or you creat an additional config-file. In this case, you can add the path to it into the logcheck.conf. 
The logcheck.conf also holds the path to the logfile of TerrariumPI and the modules/log-Levels, written into the logfile.
You just have to uncomment the searched modules and log-Levels.

To automate the script, just add a cronjob.
